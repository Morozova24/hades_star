          Transport ships are crucial to trade. They are used to deliver cargo between planets and satellites, as well as to transfer artifacts from Red and White Stars. Transports are the backbone of your fleets.

          On level 3 of the transports have the option to install the support module, which can be used to turn a ship that is otherwise unsuitable for combat, a decent support ship for battleships.

          However, the main installed modules are the trade-ins. As a result, more than one support module is not installed on the transport.

          Mining ships (mining) can collect hydrogen from asteroid fields.  These ships are slow. The minimum value of hydrogen use is used for movement, the Installation of mining modules on mining ships can significantly increase the production of hydrogen. Without proper amount of these vehicles, hydrogen will be in short supply.  Ships can produce hydrogen wherever it is â€“ in their system, systems with whom diplomatic relations have been established the Red or White Stars.
          Starting from the 3rd level of the ship, support modules can be installed in them. As well as in cases with transport vehicles on these vehicles more than one support module is not installed.
          The ship has a number of sectors after which the collection will stop collecting hydrogen (this information is displayed briefly as "sectors". If the ship is reassigned, the counter resumes. The higher the level of the ship, the more sectors it will process without interventio. Speed - 432 AU/m

          A warship that can be equipped with weapons, shield, or support modules.  Battleships, is focused on fighting. The damaged hull of the battleships can be repaired on the colonized planets,moon or station, which takes time.
          You can't install more than one shield and one weapon module.
          Battleships have a higher baseline consumption of hydrogen in comparison with other ships of equal level, and also moved faster. They have more support modules than any other ship and are the most expensive to build and upgrade.
          There is no battle between the players except for the action on the White Stars. Ie battleships will not shoot at the ships of another player on the Red Stars. Shooting at a target based on the principle "closer to it and then shoot". Translate the fire after the start of firing can only be tactically moving the battleship.
