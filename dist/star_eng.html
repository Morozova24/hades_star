            On planets in Red Stars are artifacts. They are guarded by Cerberus. The higher the level of the red Star the higher the level of artifacts.To get in they must have a minimum of influence (requirements) corresponding to the level of the red Star. The life time of an open Red Star of any level is 15 minutes. To have a positive effect on the action on the Red Star, you need to go beyond the minimum threshold (hit the hits). By the result of the action on Red Star, the player will be added or subtracted the influence points. The maximum number of players for all levels of Red Stars is limited to a limit of 4 players.

            Action on the White Stars (hereafter WS), where two corporations are fighting among themselves for the relics occur in two stages:
            - search white star (up to 12 hours time);
            - preparation of and action on WS (5 days of which 12 hours of training)
          </p>

          <p class="section__text">
            For the duration of the ships involved in the WS, it is impossible to recall for other actions, so increase the number of units of its fleet to ships sent to the WS, did not create difficulties in the maintenance and development of its system.
          </p>

          <p class="section__text">
            In WS system it is possible to destroy not only the ships of Cerbers, but also the ships of the players opposing the Corporation. In cases of the destruction of your ship, put it back in WS after 18 hours. To enter ships in the WS provides a time delay, which is shown over the icon of WS - the Format is determined by the number of members of the Corporation: 5x5,10x10,15x15. The more participants, the WS more richer. Corporations are struggling to get and claim relics that are generated on planets scattered across the WS. The weight of each relic is 4 ton. To accelerate the regeneration of relics on the planet should bring hydrogen, which is going to Mining ships from asteroids in the vastness of the system WS. Removal of relics from the territory of the WS is carried out through the WS of your Corporation. Keep in mind that the enemy will strongly interfere with the removal of relics, to the point of destroying your vehicles. Time in WS slows down 600 times.
            The tool "time Machine" (activation – click on the star icon) shows what events will occur in the future on the basis of existing data at the moment. The maximum allowable transfer time to 48 hours ahead from the current one.  In the car you can specify commands to ships, activate the modules that will be executed when the specified future point in time. It can be seen the list of future orders (not more than 8 comands on one ship), but the actions of opposing corporations are only visible at the moment.
            The reward for participation in the WS will be the calculation on the balance of credits, hydrogen and a few crystals on the results of the exported artifacts and actions of the player. In case of exceeding the storage limits, the reward will be transferred to the crystals at a reduced rate.
            Each time you use the modules, depending on their level, points are awarded, on which the player is paid a reward. It is logical that before you finish the WS, it is recommended to include them.

            Blue stars (NWs) are collapsing systems, the lifetime of which is extremely limited up to the moment of supernova, not more than 5 minutes.
            A player's ship that is out of the field (red circle) is eliminated.
            The total number of participants varies from 4 to 5 people. Third-party battleships that do not belong to any players (bots) can also take part in the battle. Also on the star system are placed Cerberus ships with the location of more powerful closer to the star. The type of Cerberus ships depends on the power of the participating battleships.
            Initially, the battleship of the player is placed in one of the extreme sectors. The purpose of the assignment for this type of stars is to hold out as long as possible. The system is not secure, i.e. in it you can fight both against Cerberus ships and against other players.
            Gradually, players are forced to move closer to the center of the system, encountering more and more powerful opponents on the way. The star itself, being unstable also causes damage to all ships passing through its sector.
            The victory is awarded to the player whose ship lasted as long as possible, while not necessarily the time to win will be 5 minutes. If all the ships of the opponents died earlier, then a victory is awarded and the ship returns to its native system.
            For a victory with a ship that is not equipped with the Asylum module, once a day, you can get 90% of the cost of this ship and modules installed on it, up to 10% of the player’s total hydrogen bank, as well as from 1 to 10 star fragments use for the station of automatic delivery of goods. The amount of hydrogen and fragments depends on the place occupied by the player at the blue star. Credits are awarded only in case of victory. You can start scanning as many times as you like. Total provides for remuneration in the form of hydrogen to 25% of the player's hydrogen bank once a day.
          </p>

          <p class="section__text">
            For participation with a ship equipped with a “Refuge” reward is paid only with hydrogen and star fragments, but in the event of a victory, no credits are paid.
